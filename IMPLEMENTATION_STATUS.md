## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES

### Minor Issues
1. ⚠️ SMS notifications require Twilio credentials (not critical)
2. ⚠️ Email sending requires AWS SES setup (emails designed but not sent)
3. ⚠️ Some test routes may need server restart to register

### Solutions
- SMS: Add TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID and TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN to .env
- Email: Add AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY to .env
- Routes: Restart server after code changes

---

## ✨ HIGHLIGHTS

### Auto-Assignment Algorithm
```python
Score Calculation:
  - Rating weight: 10x (higher rating = more points)
  - Load balancing: -0.01 per completed job
  - Daily capacity: -5 per job today
  - Max 3 jobs per day per cleaner
  
Result: Cleaners with high ratings and lower workload get priority
```

### Commission Structure
```
Booking Amount: $150
Cleaner Commission: 70% = $105
Company Share: 30% = $45
```

### Email Notifications

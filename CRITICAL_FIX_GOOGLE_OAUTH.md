# üö® CRITICAL: Google OAuth Still Failing

## Current Situation

From the server logs, I can see the backend is sending:
```
'redirect_uri': 'https://foodsensescale.tech/api/auth/google/callback'
```

Google is rejecting it with: `redirect_uri_mismatch`

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL CHECKS:

### 1. Did you click SAVE in Google Cloud Console?
- After adding the URI, you **MUST** click the blue "Save" button at the bottom
- Changes won't take effect until you save

### 2. Are you looking at the CORRECT OAuth Client?
In your Google Cloud Console screenshot, the Client ID shown is:
```
758684152649-uss73uc32io23s8l519lc2fcem4u6adc.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

This **MATCHES** your backend configuration ‚úÖ

### 3. Did you add the EXACT URI?
The URI must be typed exactly as:
```
https://foodsensescale.tech/api/auth/google/callback
```

**Common mistakes:**
- ‚ùå `https://foodsensescale.tech/api/auth/google/callback/` (extra slash at end)
- ‚ùå `http://foodsensescale.tech/api/auth/google/callback` (http instead of https)
- ‚ùå `https://www.foodsensescale.tech/api/auth/google/callback` (www subdomain)
- ‚ùå Any spaces before or after the URL

### 4. Wait Time
- Changes can take **5-30 minutes** to propagate
- Google's servers need time to update globally

---

## üì∏ PLEASE VERIFY IN GOOGLE CONSOLE:

Can you confirm in your Google Cloud Console that you see this EXACT entry in the "Authorized redirect URIs" list:

```
https://foodsensescale.tech/api/auth/google/callback
```

Take a screenshot after saving and verify it shows up in the list.

## üîß ALTERNATIVE FIX: Check for Multiple OAuth Clients

Sometimes there are multiple OAuth clients configured. Let's verify you're editing the correct one:

### Your Backend Uses:
- Client ID: `758684152649-uss73uc32io23s8l519lc2fcem4u6adc`

### To Verify:
1. In Google Cloud Console, go to "APIs & Services" ‚Üí "Credentials"
2. Look for ALL OAuth 2.0 Client IDs
3. Make sure you're editing the one that ends with `...uss73uc32io23s8l519lc2fcem4u6adc`

## üöÄ TEMPORARY WORKAROUND (While waiting for Google)

If you need to test immediately, you can temporarily use localhost:

### Option A: Test Locally
1. Change backend .env:
   ```
   GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/api/auth/google/callback
   ```

2. Restart backend:
   ```bash
   pm2 restart server
   ```

3. Access via: `http://localhost:3000` (not the production URL)

### Option B: Force Google Console Update
1. Remove ALL redirect URIs from Google Console
2. Click Save
3. Wait 5 minutes
4. Add back ONLY these two:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/api/auth/google/callback
   https://foodsensescale.tech/api/auth/google/callback
   ```
5. Click Save
6. Wait 10 minutes

## üìã Verification Checklist

Please confirm:
- [ ] I opened the correct OAuth Client (ID ending in ...uss73uc32io23s8l519lc2fcem4u6adc)
- [ ] I added the EXACT URI: `https://foodsensescale.tech/api/auth/google/callback`
- [ ] I clicked the blue "Save" button at the bottom
- [ ] I see the URI in the list after saving
- [ ] I waited at least 10 minutes after saving
- [ ] I cleared my browser cache or used Incognito mode
- [ ] I'm testing on https://foodsensescale.tech (not localhost)

---

## üîç What to Check Next

If you've done all of the above and it still doesn't work:

1. **Check Google Console again** - Refresh the page and verify the URI is still there
2. **Try a different browser** - Sometimes browser cache issues persist
3. **Check for typos** - Copy the URI directly from here and paste it
4. **Wait longer** - Sometimes Google takes up to 30 minutes

---

## üí° The URI That Google Is Expecting

Based on your current configuration, Google is looking for this EXACT match:

**Client ID:** 758684152649-uss73uc32io23s8l519lc2fcem4u6adc.apps.googleusercontent.com
**Redirect URI:** https://foodsensescale.tech/api/auth/google/callback

Both must match exactly in Google Cloud Console for the client with that ID.

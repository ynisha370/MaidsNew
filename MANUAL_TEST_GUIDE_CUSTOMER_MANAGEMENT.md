3. Navigate to the "Bookings" tab
4. Filter or search for the customer's bookings
5. Verify that multiple weekly bookings exist for the same customer
6. Check that booking dates are 7 days apart
7. Repeat with bi-weekly and monthly frequencies

**Expected Result**:
- Weekly bookings: 12+ instances created
- Bi-weekly bookings: 12+ instances created  
- Monthly bookings: 12+ instances created
- All dates are correctly calculated
- All bookings have the same customer and service details

### Scenario 4: Test Guest Customer Booking

### Scenario 5: Test Pricing Calculation
**Objective**: Verify accurate pricing calculations

**Steps**:

   - House size: "3000-3500"
   - Frequency: "Monthly"
   - Rooms: 4 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, kitchen, living room
   - A la carte services: Deep cleaning
2. Review the pricing breakdown
3. Verify calculations:
   - Base price for house size and frequency
   - Room pricing (bedrooms √ó price + bathrooms √ó price + boolean rooms)
   - A la carte service pricing
   - Total amount

**Expected Result**:
- Base price: $50 (3000-3500 monthly)
- Room pricing: (4 √ó $12.50) + (3 √ó $15) + (2 √ó $8.50) = $50 + $45 + $17 = $112
- A la carte: Deep cleaning price
- Total: Base + Rooms + A la carte

### Scenario 6: Test Error Handling
**Objective**: Verify proper error handling and validation

**Steps**:
1. Try to create a booking with missing required fields
2. Try to create a booking with invalid customer ID
3. Try to create a booking with past date
4. Try to create a booking with invalid time slot
5. Verify error messages are displayed

**Expected Result**:
- Appropriate error messages for each validation failure
- No bookings created with invalid data
- User-friendly error descriptions

## 📱 **Ready for Frontend Integration**

### **Booking Agreement Checkbox**
```html
<input type="checkbox" id="agreement-checkbox" required>
I understand that recurring service pricing requires a minimum of three consecutive cleanings.
If service is canceled before the third cleaning, a $200 early cancelation fee will be charged to the card on file.
I also understand that any concerns about the quality of service must be reported by the end of the day of the cleaning.
```

### **Waitlist Popup**
```javascript
// When capacity is reached
if (bookingResponse.waitlist_required) {
    showWaitlistModal({
        message: "We're currently at capacity for this date. We value you and hope to service your home soon!",
        waitlistMessage: "We're currently full for that slot — would you like to join our Waitlist?"
    });
}
```

### **Capacity Status Display**
```javascript
// Show availability on calendar
const capacityStatus = await fetch('/api/capacity/status');
// Display green (available) or red (waitlist) indicators
```

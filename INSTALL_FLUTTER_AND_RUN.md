   - Wait for download to complete
   - Click **"Next"**

5. **Verify Configuration**:
   - AVD Name: Pixel_5_API_33 (or similar)

```

---

## 🎯 Step 5: Run the Flutter App

### Navigate to Flutter App Directory:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\yniti\Documents\GitHub\MaidsNew\flutter_app
```

### Install Dependencies:

## 🚀 Alternative: Run Without Installing Flutter

If you can't install Flutter right now, you can:

1. **Use the Flutter online demo** at https://flutter.dev/
2. **Use Android Studio with pre-built APK** (we can build this for you)
3. **Install Flutter later** and use the complete guide above

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

You'll know everything is working when:

1. ✅ Emulator shows Android home screen
2. ✅ `flutter devices` shows your emulator
3. ✅ App compiles without errors (takes a few minutes first time)
4. ✅ App icon appears on emulator
5. ✅ App launches automatically
6. ✅ Login screen appears with blue gradient
7. ✅ You can login with cleaner credentials
8. ✅ Dashboard shows your name and stats
9. ✅ Bottom navigation works
10. ✅ All tabs are accessible

---

## 📞 Next Steps

### Option 1: Install Flutter Now
Follow the steps above to install Flutter and run the app.

### Option 2: Use Pre-Built APK
I can help you build an APK file that you can directly install on the emulator.

### Option 3: Demo Mode
The app has demo data built-in, so it works without a backend connection for testing UI.
